# Predicting No-Shows in Hospitals
In this notebook I look at the ["Medical Appointment No Shows" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments) on www.kaggle.com

After cleaning the data, I will use a Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression to predict future no shows and compare the performance of these three Machine Learning models.
